# Game-Of-Life
This program is based on "The Game Of Life" by mathematician John Conway.
This is one of the first programs I wrote that I was proud of, even though looking back on it now, it's quite a mess!
This is before I really knew how to use Java as an object oriented langauge. I should have made at least 4 or more different classes. I wrote this with no outside help (other than the rules of the game) and very little googling as a challenge. I was new to both object oriented programming and the Swing class. This was a great learning experience.
